      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to StyleSwap! These Terms and Conditions govern your use of our
        website and services. By renting or listing items, you agree to be bound
        by these terms.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. The Service</h2>
      <p>
        StyleSwap provides an online platform that connects clothing owners with
        individuals seeking to rent clothing for temporary use. We act as an
        intermediary and are not a party to any rental agreement between users.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.1. Lenders</h3>
      <p>
        As a Lender, you agree to provide accurate descriptions and photos of
        your items. Items must be clean and in good condition. You are
        responsible for setting your rental price and availability.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3.2. Renters</h3>
      <p>
        As a Renter, you agree to treat rented items with care. You are
        responsible for returning items on time and in the same condition you
        received them, barring normal wear and tear. Late fees will apply for
        items not returned by the agreed-upon date.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Damage and Loss</h2>
      <p>
        Renters are liable for any significant damage, loss, or theft of a
        rented item. The cost of repair or replacement will be charged to the
        Renter, up to the full retail value of the item. A security deposit may
        be held for this purpose.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Payments and Fees</h2>
      <p>
        All payments are processed securely through our platform. StyleSwap
        charges a service fee to both the Lender and the Renter on each
        transaction. This fee covers platform maintenance, customer support, and
        payment processing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Cancellations made by a Renter more than 7 days before the rental start
        date will receive a full refund. Cancellations made within 7 days are
        non-refundable. Lenders who cancel frequently may be subject to penalties
        or account suspension.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Prohibited Use</h2>
      <p>
        You may not use our service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.
        Users found to be in violation of our policies will have their accounts
        terminated immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">8. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will notify
        users of any significant changes. Continued use of the service after
        such changes constitutes your consent to the new terms.
